        <p>
          A database is an organized collection of structured information, or
          data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database
          is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

        <p>
          Modules are common website components that are used like building
          blocks to create pages. Each module is a collection of “generic”
          elements — images, text, buttons, etc. Many modules are combined to
          build a page.

        <h2>Computer Communication</h2>
        <img class="modules__image" src="/image/communication.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          The communications module encodes the message onto the network's
          physical medium representing a link to another system. If the
          communications module implements a best-effort message service, it
          generates the confirm primitive as soon as the message has been
          encoded onto the medium.

        <p>
          A program is a list of instructions or program statements composed in
          such a way as to enable a computer to solve a problem. The problem to
          be solved is broken down into successively smaller parts.

        <p>
          A module is a software component or part of a program that contains
          one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make
          up a program. An enterprise-level software application may contain
          several different modules, and each module serves unique and separate
          business operations.

        <p>
          A computer module is a selection of independent electronic circuits
          packaged onto a circuit board to provide a basic function within a
          computer. An example might be an inverter or flip-flop, which would
          require two or more transistors and a small number of additional
          supporting devices.
